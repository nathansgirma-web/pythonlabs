    "First, please use [Moodle Quiz Lab 1](https://moodle.metropolia.fi/course/view.php?id=1960) to learn the basics of creating numerical arrays and creating functions. Notice, Moodle problems are designed to be solved in order. The next problem is build on the topics learnt in the previous tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, your aim is to find *graphically* [the roots (zeroes) for the function](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_a_function). A root of a function is found, when `f(x) = 0`, e.g. when the value of the function is zero. So, create another code where you zoom in to the graph of the function until you find the values for x, when `f(x) = 0`.\n",

    "Use `matplotlib`-library's `xlim` and `ylim` functions to zoom in to the graph. Iterate and try different values for axes limits until you have found the roots with *two decimals accuracy*. Search more help from `matplotlib.pyplot` documentation.\n",
